				<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
				<!-- about you -->
				<p>I am a hard hitting seasoned IT professional with 20+ years of experience that has worked in all kinds of different environments
				ranging from highly technical top secret underground communication network operating center’s in the military to helping
				non tech savvy users in the retail industry and everything in between. I have a repetative track record of surpassing the expectations of my employers. 
				I’m equally as efficient working by myself unsupervised as I am brainstorming in a team with other likeminded IT ninjas like myself.
				Over the years I have earned many certifications in various disciplines with the most recent being in AWS cloud services. Contining education and
				professsional development are very important to me and I constantly strive to better myself and the people around me. I
				have never shy’d away from a challenge and welcome new opportunities to prove myself and get things done.</p>

				<h2>MY CAREER OBJECTIVES</h2>
				<p>
					I’m looking to obtain a long term position in a leading information technology company that promotes
					opportunities for
					growth and inspires a culture of continuing education.
